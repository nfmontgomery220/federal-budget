analysis of federal budget
Core Message:
The latest federal budget isn't just another set of numbers—it's a wake-up call. If passed, it will deepen debt, jeopardize essential services, and ignore the voices of small business owners, educators, and working communities. We believe Americans deserve more than a backseat in budget decisions—they deserve a seat at the table.

🎯 Why This Matters to You
👩‍💼 Small Business Owners
You fuel our economy, yet key programs that support entrepreneurship and fair markets face cuts while large interests secure their share. By shaping a public budget, you can spotlight what truly drives local prosperity—access to capital, fair tax policy, and infrastructure investment.

👨‍🏫 Educators & Schools
Classrooms are already stretched thin. The current proposal sidelines education while increasing inefficiencies elsewhere. You’ve seen what students need. Your insights belong in the budgeting process—not as an afterthought, but as a foundation.

🏘️ Community Organizers
Budget decisions made far from your neighborhoods often fail to reflect your reality. Whether it’s housing, transit, or healthcare, you know where the gaps are. Your voice can help redirect funding where it’s needed most.
